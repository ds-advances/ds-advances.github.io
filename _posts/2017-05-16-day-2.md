  title: Efficient semi-complete data likelihood approaches (and making the most out of the BUGS/JAGS black-box)
  institute: University of Edinburgh
  url: http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics/people/show?person=446
  abstract: "Data Science drives both the development of new models to fit to data to better describe the underlying system and the associated model-fitting tools for efficiently conducting statistical analyses of real data. We will consider the particular issue where the associated likelihood of the model is analytically intractable. A common technique in this case is to use a Bayesian data augmentation technique, where the parameter space is expanded via the specification of auxiliary variables, such that the “complete data likelihood” of the observed data and auxiliary variables is straightforward to write down.  Such techniques can be applied in standard software such as BUGS (Bayesian inference Using the Gibbs Sampler) and JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler), which are widely used throughout the scientific community – particularly as the associated Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is effectively a hidden black-box. However, standard MCMC algorithms can perform very poorly due to highly correlated parameters. We propose a semi-complete data likelihood approach, which can significantly improve the performance of standard vanilla MCMC algorithms. We demonstrate this by applying the idea to applications in statistical ecology, implemented using the software JAGS."

  title: "Enabling open science and data science via software: scikit-learn"
  institute: INRIA
  url: http://gael-varoquaux.info/
  abstract: "Data science, with sophisticated data processing, is having a
transformational impact on many facets of science and society. It is
driven by a technological revolution based on statistical models, and
software implementing them. Outreach, bridging the technical gap outside
of the ivory tower of research lab and high-margin tech ventures, is
crucial to see data-science applications of the beaten track. Scikit-learn is a machine-learning software that strives to reach many
users and applications. Via the rich Python data ecosystem it can be
embedded any domain or workflow. It has hundreds of thousands of users in
a variety of field in the industry or in academia. I will discuss how we
built scikit-learn to be easy-to-use and didactic; how we grew a
community of open-source developers with a focus on collaboration; how we
ensure quality in a statistical-learning codebase; how we try to distill
the most important progress from the rapid pace of academic publishing;
and how we are struggling to make the development sustainable."

  title: Telling Stories with data
  institute: Tableau Software

  abstract: "People don’t remember numbers, they remember stories. If you want to communicate data driven findings to an audience, then you need to be able to tell a compelling story with your numbers. Numbers might not change the world, but the story they are telling just might. We look at data visualisations, the stories they tell, and the methods used to tell them."

  title: "Beyond conscious thought: using data about perception to understand cognition"
  institute: University of Manchester
  url: https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/Caroline.Jay.html
  abstract: "Humans continuously gather data from the environment to form judgements and guide behaviour. While many decisions appear to be made at a conscious level, they are strongly influenced by the perceptual processes used to obtain the relevant information, and by the editing that the brain performs to prevent the conscious mind being overwhelmed by vast amounts of noisy data. 

Our perceptual behaviour has a profound affect on how we understand the world, but the process by which it occurs is subjectively hard to articulate. This talk discusses how we can use computational methods to monitor and make sense of these complex perceptual processes, providing a window on subconscious cognition, and laying the foundations for technology that could vastly improve our decision making capabilities."

  title: "Changepoint challenges: making sense of industrial sensor data"
  institute: Lancaster University
  url: http://www.lancs.ac.uk/~eckley/
  abstract: The prevalence of high quality sensors within business and industrial systems has resulted in a torrent of data. Typically, these sensors are capable of recording data on several different attributes at very high rates (kHz or GHz). These signals pose many important challenges for data science. Arguably one of the most fundamental of these is the identification of when the statistical properties of the signal have changed. This requires the development of efficient and accurate methods, capable of detecting potentially subtle changes in signal composition. This talk will focus on the challenge of efficiently estimating the locations of changepoints, i.e. abrupt changes, within such signals and, in particular, the benefits of parallelisation together with details of key statistical properties that can be established in this setting.

  title: Data-Driven and Science-Driven Statistical Methods in Astronomy and Solar Physics
  institute: Imperial College London
  url: https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~dvandyk/
  abstract: In recent years, technological advances have dramatically increased the quality and quantity of data available to astronomers.  Newly launched or soon-to-be launched space-based telescopes are tailored to data-collection challenges associated with specific scientific goals. These instruments provide massive new surveys resulting in new catalogs containing terabytes of data, high resolution spectrography and imaging across the electromagnetic spectrum, and incredibly detailed movies of dynamic and explosive processes in the solar atmosphere. The spectrum of new instruments is helping scientists make impressive strides in our understanding of the physical universe, but at the same time generating massive data-analytic and data-mining challenges for scientists who study the resulting data. In this talk I will illustrate and discuss the interplay of data science, statistics, data-driven methods, and science-driven methods in the context of several problems in astrophysics.
