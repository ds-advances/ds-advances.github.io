  title: Offline biases in online platforms
  abstract: "Sharing economy platforms have recently come under fire due to reports of discriminatory behaviours among their users. This raises an important question: are sharing economy platforms fair marketplaces, where all participants operate on a level playing field, or are they large-scale online aggregators of offline human biases &quest In this talk, I will focus on behaviours of homophily and avoidance, and propose a method based on the statistical analysis of networks to detect and quantify them. I apply this method to study the host-guest pairings in the Airbnb platform. This analysis, conducted over five cities in three continents, finds ample evidence of gender, age and ethnic homophily; in parallel, it also finds clear evidence of avoidance between users from different ethnic backgrounds. Based on these findings, I will discuss platform design recommendations, aimed at exposing and possibly reducing the biases detected, in support of a more inclusive growth of sharing economy platforms."

  title:"Online Users' Behaviour Understanding and Prediction with Data Science"
  abstract:"Large concern by public has emerged recently about social media data can reveal about users. In this talk, some examples are presented of how public social media data could be explored with data science to predict users' behaviour and societies trends, including public interest, individual preferences, and personal information. Example studies on the US election, hate-speech, opinion change, and fake accounts are covered in this talk. All analysis are applied on publically available data, which might give an indication about what could be done further if private data is used."

  title: "Early indicators of the number of visitors to museums based on Google data"
  abstract: The number of visitors to museums is a key indicator of the performance of cultural institutions. Being able to have early estimates of visits is of crucial importance for cultural policy makers who need to allocate resources and funding, or to evaluate the impact of cultural policies. Traditional data gathering and processing methods result in delayed estimates on the number of visitors to free museums. Here, we show how our information gathering process using the online search engine Google could help policy makers have early and accurate estimates of the number of people visiting a museum or gallery. Additionally, we present a tool which allows cultural policy makers to easily explore the analysis and interact with the data in a non-technical manner. Our results provide further evidence that publicly available data sets detailing our online behaviour can be used to better understand the current state of society.
