  title: Artificial Intelligence for Data Analytics
  abstract: "A common view is that up to 80% of work on a data mining project is involved in data understanding, cleaning and preparation, yet machine learning has not focused very much on these topics.  I will describe issues around data parsing, obtaining (or inferring) a data dictionary, data integration, entity resolution, structural variability, identifying and repairing missing data, and anomaly detection and repair. I will discuss work from the AIDA project at the Alan Turing Institute which addresses some of these issues.

Joint work with Taha Ceritli, James Geddes, Zoubin Ghahramani, Ernesto Jimenez-Ruiz, Ian Horrocks, Alfredo Nazabal, Tomas Petricek, Charles Sutton, and Gerrit Van Den Burg."
